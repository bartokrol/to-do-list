# ToDo List created in React

This is a ToDo List created to train my programming skills in SCSS, JavaScript and React.

## Running

After you clone it from GitHub to your local folder.
To download node modules, use:

```
"npm install"
```

To open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser, use:

```
"npm start"
```

## ToDo List inputs

ToDo List inputs consist of two inputs ("taskHeader" and "taskDesc").
The "tashHeader" value has to be longer than 3 signs, and "taskDesc" value has to longer than 10 signs.
Only when those conditions are true, the new task can be add.
